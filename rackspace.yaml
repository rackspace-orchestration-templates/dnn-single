  #### Getting Started
  If you are new to DNN, the [DNN
  Community](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community) has great ressources to
  get you started including a well maintained
  [Wiki](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/wiki). DNN provides [Professional
  Services and Training](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/solutions/services),
  and DNN Extensions are available through the [DNN
  Store](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/).

  #### Logging into DNN
  To login, use the IP address of the server or point an A record to your
  server's IP. The domain you provided has also been used to set the [host
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on the server. Therefore you can open an RDP session to the server,
  open the domain in the web browser and pursue the last step of the DNN
  site activation.

  Once you have the server's IP or the domain name open in the web browser,
  you must complete the Account information form and the Website
  information form. The Database Information section MUST remain unchanged
  because it has been configured in the connection string in the
  Web.config, and the database has been set to use the application pool
  identity.

  #### Additional Licensing
  DNN is open source under the [MIT
  Licence](https://dotnetnuke.codeplex.com/license).

  #### Logging in via Remote Desktop
  The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
  [here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
  to login and begin managing DNN.

  #### Uploading Files via FTP
  The FTP password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. You may use [Filezilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
  or [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) with the FTP credential to upload your application.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This setup was built through a [Powershell
  Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
  Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
  safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within
  DNN.
